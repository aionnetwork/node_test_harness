/**
 * A system-wide lock around resources used by the test harness.  Lock is implemented
 * by lock on the filesystem.  Intended to limit the number of concurrent executions
 * of test cases per single machine, so that orchestrators (i.e. Jenkins) can invoke
 * these Functional Tests without the kernel of each test clashing with one another
 * and/or using too much system resources.
 *
 * Each HarnessLock takes a name.  The lock for any particular name can only be
 * acquired once (until it is released).  Two HarnessLock objects with the same
 * name refer to the same lock.
 *
 * This is not intended to provide a lock to be used within tests.  It should only
 * be used by the test harness itself to ensure no system runs two instances of
 * test harness concurrently.  One HarnessLock object should not be acquired by
 * multiple threads (but the underlying file can be).
